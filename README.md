# Image Opt

Image optimizer. Takes JPEG/JPG, PNG, SVG and GIF images and optimizes them, while optionally resizing and generating low quality/low filesize 'asyncrhonous' versions of the images, with further options for abstract versions of the async images in the form of pixellation and tessellation. At time of writing, pretty early in development.
